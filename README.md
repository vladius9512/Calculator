# Calculator
Calculator Project i did to finish Odin Project Foundations

## [Live Demo](https://vladius9512.github.io/Calculator/)

## Things i learned:

* That i should commit on git after every session of working on a project, even if it is just a small improvement.
+ Taking a break from the project is usefull (if it is not too long), to let the brain get some new ideas.
+ To addEventListener only to a specific element, not to the whole document (like i used to on smaller projects).
+ Also it was the first time i used obj.forEach. 
+ Trying to brake my own app is good at helping bug fixes and not to test the app with only simple inputs. 


Exercise is key.
